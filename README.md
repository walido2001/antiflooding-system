# antiflooding-system
An anti flooding system built with javaFX and Arduino, consists of an Arduino Grove board, LED's, beepers, and a water pump. 
System contains 2 modes: automatic and manual. In automatic mode, the pump will instantly activate the moment the water sensor detects rising water levels.
Meanwhile, in manual, the system will alert the individual of a rising flood through a beeper and blinking lights.
